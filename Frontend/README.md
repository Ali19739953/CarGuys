Here’s a complete README.md file for your React + Vite project with a detailed explanation, Git workflow, and instructions to avoid merge conflicts:

React + Vite Project
This project is built using Vite to provide a fast and minimal setup for React development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and linting rules. Make sure to follow Git best practices when working with the repository to avoid conflicts.

#**Important Git Workflow Notice**
#⚠️ DO NOT merge or resolve conflicts unless you are fully knowledgeable about using Bitbucket and Git. **Conflicts caused by improper merges waste time and can cause errors in the project.**
Be cautious with Git commands and seek assistance if unsure.

Basic Run Command
To run the development server, use the following command:

npm run dev
This will start the Vite dev server with HMR for quick and efficient development.

Plugins Used
Currently, this project uses two official Vite plugins to enhance development with React:

@vitejs/plugin-react
Uses Babel for Fast Refresh, ensuring HMR works smoothly during development.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
Utilizes the SWC compiler for faster refresh and optimized builds. You can switch to this plugin for faster builds if needed.


**Installation and Setup**
Clone the repository:


git clone <repository-url>
Install the dependencies:


npm install
Run the project in development mode:


npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the app.

**DO NOT DO IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE**
Build for Production
To create a production build, run:

npm run build
This will generate the production-ready files in the dist/ folder.

Git Workflow Best Practices
To maintain a smooth development process, adhere to these Git rules:

Feature Branches: Always create a new branch for features or fixes. Do not push changes directly to the main branch.

git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
Commit Messages: Write meaningful commit messages. Always describe what you have done, so others understand the purpose of the change.

**IMPORTANT**
Pull Requests: Submit a pull request for every feature branch and request a review before merging.

Conflict Resolution: Avoid resolving conflicts unless you are certain how to resolve them correctly. If you encounter a merge conflict, ask for assistance from team members with Git experience.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during development:

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed and up to date.
Check the Vite documentation for more detailed configuration options.
